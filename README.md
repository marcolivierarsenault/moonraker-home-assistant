# Moonraker Home Assistant

Non official integration for Moonraker and Klipper in Home Assistant (via HACS).

# Supported Entities

This allows you home assistant to connect to your 3D printer and display:

- Key informations about the printer (sensors)
- Show the camera image (if installed)
- Thumbnail of what is being printed at the moment.
- Emergency stop button
- Button to trigger macros

To access the list of all entities and their documentations, look at our [documentation](https://moonraker-home-assistant.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The list of entities keeps growing on each versions :rocket: . Keep an eye on the releases.

## Hardware Limits

This software seems to have issues working on **FLSUN Speeder Pad** and **Sonic Pad**, so those are unsuported.

# Install

## Install via HACS

- Once HACS is installed, search for `moonraker`
  - Navigate to the 'Integrations' tab in HACS, click `explore & Download` and search for the 'Moonraker' integration there. On the next screen, select "Download". Once fully downloaded, restart HomeAssistant.
- In the sidebar, click 'Configuration', then 'Devices & Services'. Click the + icon to add "Moonraker" to your Home Assistant installation.
  - Enter the host or IP of your Moonraker installation.
  - Change your printer's port if you don't use the default of 7125.
